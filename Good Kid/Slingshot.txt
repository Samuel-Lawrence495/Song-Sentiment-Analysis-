Well I've been waiting for all these years just to see you come back home
But each step that you took towards her, well, you took each one alone
And every time you said, "My God, how is it up there on that throne?"
Well I've been waiting undefeated just to hear you say that I'm not needed

I said I was an honest man
You said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it
Well I think you're just afraid of the fall
But you won't be there at all, no you won't be there and
Oh, my, God, I hope you're falling apart
My God, I hope you're falling if you
Oh, my, God, I hope you're falling apart
It's going to be the start of what you are

Well I remember when you said that you hate everything I do
You didn't have a reason then, wish I'd given one to you
And then you would say, "Oh, my, God, I couldn't know what you've been through"
Well I've been waiting undefeated just to hear you say that I'm not needed

I said I was an honest man
You said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it
Well I think you're just afraid of the fall
But you won't be there at all, no you won't be there and
Oh, my, God, I hope you're falling apart
My God, I hope you're falling if you
Oh, my, God, I hope you're falling apart
It's going to be the start of what you are

I said I was an honest man
You said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it
Well I think you're just afraid of the fall
But you won't be there at all, no you won't be there
Oh, my, God, I hope you're falling apart
(Said I was an honest man)
My God, I hope you're falling if you
(Said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it)
Oh, my, God, I hope you're falling apart
(Said I was an honest man)
It's going to be the start of what you
(Said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it)
Oh, my, God, I hope you're falling apart
(Said I was an honest man)
My God, I hope you're falling if you
(Said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it)
Oh, my, God, I hope you're falling apart
(Said I was an honest man)
It's going to the start of what you are
