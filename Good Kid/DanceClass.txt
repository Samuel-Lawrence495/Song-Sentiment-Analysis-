I met you in the yellow light of a sign that bore your name
You said it was a coincidence, but one you can't explain
Said I'm not going to read more of it than I should
But when you smiled, I knew I always would

I wanna meet you at a slow dance
I wanna meet you but it's too soon
I wanna meet you but I can't speak
Or dare to cross the room
I wanna meet you at a slow dance
I wanna meet you but it's too soon
I wanna meet you but I can't speak
Or dare to cross the room, but I am trying

Stuck beneath the spinning glow of a familiar hue
Struck by your impression like all of those next to you
But I will try to stand and make it down the hall
But in that sound, I'm barely here at all

I wanna meet you at a slow dance
I wanna meet you but it's too soon
I wanna meet you but I can't speak
Or dare to cross the room
I wanna meet you at a slow dance
I wanna meet you but it's too soon
I wanna meet you but I can't speak
Or dare to cross the room
But I am trying so hard to meet you where you are

I wanna meet you at a slow dance
I wanna meet you but it's too soon
I wanna meet you but I can't speak
Or dare to cross the room
I wanna meet you in a slow dance
I wanna meet you but it's too soon
I wanna meet you but I can't speak
Or dare to cross the room
But I am trying so hard
