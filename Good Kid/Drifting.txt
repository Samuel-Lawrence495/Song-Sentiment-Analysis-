Sorry, baby, I just don't know the words
Or how to conjugate them
Was it really past tense I heard?
Or was it present perfect?
Maybe we could forget the time
You faced that friend without me
Maybe we could go back to mine
Pretend it never happened

Oh, when you're always out of time
When you say it will be fine
When I just can't find the line
Oh, hope I know what to say
When you throw it all away

Sorry, baby, I've been drifting again
Could you repeat the question?
No, I guess I do not know when
It first became a problem
Sorry that it's all such a mess
The words, they seem to leave me
Didn't really quite catch the rest
Not keen on it repeating

Oh, when you're always out of time
When you say it will be fine
When I just can't find the line
Oh, hope I know what to say
When you throw it all away
When you throw it all away

Sorry, baby, I just don't know the words
Was it really past tense I heard?
Maybe we can forget the time
Maybe we can go back to mine

Well, I think that I've been drifting
Without you, drifting
I think that I've been drifting
Without you, drifting
I think that I've been drifting
Without you, drifting
I think that I've been drifting
Without you, drifting
And now I know that you've been gone
