Faster and faster, dear
It's like we're moving backwards in a rearview mirror
The road evened out by the snow, evened out by-

I can feel, I know you feel it too
A little flicker on the path
We steer of subtle flashing lights
We'll go faster and faster

This time, my mind, it won't forget
This time, my mind, we're not there yet
This time, it goes faster and faster
This time, my mind, it won't forget
This time, my mind, we're not there yet
This time, it goes faster and faster

Faster and faster, dear
The road's still moving backwards, now it looks so clear
The snow evened out by the road, evened out by-

I can still recall the twists and turns
But it feels so straight ahead
A little farther till the end
We'll go faster and faster

This time, my mind, it won't forget
This time, my mind, we're not there yet
This time, it goes faster and faster
This time, my mind, it won't forget
This time, my mind, we're not there yet
This time, it goes faster and faster

This time, my mind, it won't forget
This time, my mind, we're not there yet
This time, my mind, it won't forget
This time, it goes faster
This time, my mind, it won't forget
This time, my mind, we're not there yet
This time, my mind, it won't forget
This time, it goes faster and faster
