Well, I lost my phone, maybe, three years back
And I don't have an address, it's a matter of fact
But I guess you tried to drop me a line
Yeah, I signed out and I unsubscribed
Then I cut the cord, now I'm not online
But I'll be fine, yeah, I guess that I'll get by
Well, I shaved my head and I grew out a beard
And now I only wear plaid, I always look austere
I'm moving to L.A., I'm writing a screenplay

But it's not about you or what we were
It's about a new girl, you've never met her
She's just got your name
And she looks exactly the same

Tell, tell, tell, tell, tell, tell me you know
Tell me it's okay
That I dropped right off the map
And I'm falling every day
Tell, tell, tell, tell, tell, tell me you know
Tell me it's okay
'Cause you'll find me anyway

Yeah, if you see me walking by
Well, I guarantee it's some other guy
'Cause I'm not there
Yeah, I'm always elsewhere

I changed my name, I had it approved
They wrote it down, you won't see it soon
I guess you'll see there's not much to me
I guess of me, there's not much to see

Tell, tell, tell, tell, tell, tell me you know
Tell me it's okay
That I dropped right off the map
And I'm falling every day
Tell, tell, tell, tell, tell, tell me you know
Tell me it's okay
'Cause you'll find me anyway

And now you'll see that there's not much left of me
Well, once a year I'll cross your path
I'll hurry away, you'll stifle a laugh
It's not that I'm scared, you just caught me unaware
Well I know it's been a couple of years
But still, I'm surprised we ended up here
We'll talk a bit to see what we've lost
You'll stop when you see you're a bit better off

Tell, tell, tell, tell, tell, tell me you know
Tell me it's okay
That I dropped right off the map
And I'm falling every day
Tell, tell, tell, tell, tell, tell me you know
Tell me it's okay
'Cause you'll find me anyway
You'll find me anyway
