It's not the same when I'm with you
You open up, I fall right through
Came out a different shade of blue
It's not the same when I'm with you

But it's always a surprise when
Oh, it's always a surprise when
The tide comes in, when the tide comes in
But it's always a surprise when
Oh, it's always a surprise when
You call again, when you call again

How long's the shoreline anyway?
I measured every other day
Tide washes all my work away
How long's the shoreline anyway?

But it's always a surprise when
Oh, it's always a surprise when
The tide comes in, when the tide comes in
But it's always a surprise when
Oh, it's always a surprise when
You call again, when you call again

But it's always a surprise when
Oh, it's always a surprise when
The tide comes in, when the tide comes in
But it's always a surprise when
Oh, it's always a surprise when
You call again, when you call again

Oh, I'm not supposed to answer (It's not the same when I'm with you)
I'm not supposed to know (You open up, I fall right through)
Oh, I'll let the silence answer (Came out a different shade of blue)
I've got to let it go (It's not the same when I'm with you)
Oh, I'm not supposed to answer (How long's the shoreline anyway?)
I'm not supposed to know (I measured every other day)
Oh, I'll let the silence answer (Tide washes all my work away)
I've got to let it go now (How long's the shoreline anyway?)
