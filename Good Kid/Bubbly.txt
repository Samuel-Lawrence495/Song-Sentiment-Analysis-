I came in a bit before the opening set
I took the bet, I know the rest
It's good, I guess
The cavern is a crowd around
And I can scarce get by
On second breath between the press
Now it's 1 a.m. and I don't know how I'll get home
The way is barely paved
I can't keep my eyes from closing in between each rest
But I'm not going to cave

I guess I made it, yeah
I said that I, I'll come along this time but when I try
I get the feeling I someday will die
And I'm not going to care

I never sleep, I never eat
I never leave my house alone
Another evening in between
What I believe and what I know
And what I know

I'm sitting on the 501
A moment's rest, a glacial pace
Who won't lose faith
Maybe if I stay or ran the rest
To prove myself, I'd still save face
Now we're on our way
Before I quit at half past 9
Can't get out of this
And now I've lost that little time

I guess I'll make it, yeah
I said that I, I'll come along this time but when I try
I get the feeling I someday will die
And I'm not going to care

I never sleep, I never eat
I never leave my house alone
Another evening in between
What I believe and what I know
I never sleep, I never eat
I never leave my house alone
Another evening in between
What I believe and what I know
And what I know

Ah!

So I walked out the back before the second set
Settled my debt
I'll miss the rest, that's fine I guess
The cavern is a crowd around (I never eat, I never sleep)
And I could scarce get by (I never leave my house alone)
On second breath between the press
Now it's 3 a.m. and I don't know how I'll get home (I never eat, I never sleep)
The way is barely paved (I never leave my house alone)
I can't keep my eyes from closing (I never eat, I never sleep)
So I'll hit replay (I never leave my house alone)
