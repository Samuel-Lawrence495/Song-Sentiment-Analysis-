Give it up, give it up, give it away
Well you were barely alive, and you learnt that day
Cut off so much, hardly remained
Well you knew that there was still a way
Cry and cave in, try anyway
Well you got him back, but then you had to pay
Stand up, push us, still to this day
Oh, you knew that there was still a way
This is your only plan
Oh, now this is your only
Now this is your only plan
Oh, now this is yours

That's fine
It's all you've ever known
A single state of mind
But you won't ever let it go

When you had the answer
And you were there alone
You left the door unopened
When you knew that you would want more

Give it up, give it up, give it away
Well you were barely aware and you learnt that day
Cut off so much, hardly remained
Oh, well you knew that there was still a way
This is your only plan
Oh, now this is your only
Now this is your only plan
Oh, now this is yours

And you're right
You'll force it to yield
You'll forge it to the lines
You'll let your callous be your shield
And everyone will say
That it all was finished years ago
But you will stay
And you won't ever let it go

When you had the answer
And you were there alone
You left the door unopened
When you knew that you would want more
Then again you found the answer
Then you were there alone
You left the door unopened
When you knew that you would want more

When you had the answer (This is your only plan, oh, now this is your only)
And you were there alone
You left the door unopened (Now this is your only plan, oh, now this is yours)
When you knew that you would want more
Then again, you found the answer (This is your only plan, oh now this is yours)
And you were there alone
You left the door unopened
When you knew that you would want more
