Like a hand reaching for a handle
But to find that it was never there
Candidly, I can't handle knowing
That it's all up in the air
I thought the world ended in March
Until I heard the doorbell ring
Can't keep from falling apart
But I'll glue back everything again

This can't be the end
This can't be the end
This can't be the end
This can't be the end of all that summer had to say
What little time has gone away
I'll glue it all back anyway
I'll glue it all back anyway

Like the wing of a sparrow or a plane
Drops down a couple feet again
To catch the wind that still remains
But I'm left breathless anyway
I thought the world ended in March
Until I heard the doorbell ring
Just me here standing in the dark
But I'll light up everything again

This can't be the end
This can't be the end
This can't be the end
This can't be the end of all that summer had to say
What little time has gone away
I'll glue it all back anyway
I'll glue it all back anyway

(I'll glue it all back anyway)
(I'll glue it all back anyway)
(I'll glue it all back anyway)
I'll glue it all back anyway

This can't be the end
This can't be the end
This can't be the end
This can't be the end of all that summer had to say (This can't be the-)
What little time has gone away (This can't be the-)
I'll glue it all back anyway (This can't be the-)
I'll glue it all back anyway
