These days all I see is everything you're not
Between those melodies, it's all I've been thinking of
Since then the lines you left behind you
They cover every bit of this home
These days it's all I've ever wanted
It's all I've ever wanted to know

What it is that keeps me from letting you go?
I don't even know
What it is that keeps me from letting you go?
I don't even know
What it is that keeps me from letting you go?
It's not what I thought
I guess we get what we want

These days all I hear are words that I forgot
And of those memories, I'd rather lose the lot
Since then the days are getting longer but I keep getting lost in the snow
These days it's all I've ever wanted
It's all I've ever wanted to know

What it is that keeps me from letting you go?
I don't even know
What it is that keeps me from letting you go?
I don't even know
What it is that keeps me from letting you go?
It's not what I thought
I guess we get what we want

I guess we get what we want
I guess we get what we want
I guess we get what we want
I guess we get what we want
