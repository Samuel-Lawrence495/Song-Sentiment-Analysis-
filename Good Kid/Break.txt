Written in the back of my old diary
"We all gotta break sometime," it's underlined in lead
Scrawled across a screen beneath the spidering
"We all gotta break sometime," I left it all unread

And the more I know the less I seem to care
Weighted down by everything and falling through the air
And the more I hold, the less that I can bear
But hey, we all gotta break sometime

Cracked inside a kiln between the firing
We all gotta break sometime, you glazed it anyway
Screamed across a city from a windowsill
"We all gotta break sometime," that's all you had to say

But the more I know the less I seem to care
Weighted down by everything and falling through the air
And the more I hold, the less that I can bear
But hey, we all gotta break sometime
