Four eyes entwined draw four separate lines
And none of them point to you
A tangled mess of knots, I confess
But the intent was there, I swear
We set our sights on something that we thought was true

So now we sit and stare across
A surface spanning the whole state
Two feet between and miles apart
No words to speak, been here a week
And still, we haven't got a clue

It falls apart, there's not a heart to beat there
It falls apart if there's not a heart to have (The animal instinct fluttering away from the start)
It falls apart, there's not a heart to beat there
It falls apart if there's not a heart to have

Each word a world all of its own
Each thought render only in groans
The syntax skips, semantics slips
And what we're left, a growing cleft
Of language lost, tokens unknown
And then I guess we slipped right through
And lost all meaning on the way
We ended up a tiny piece
Of every heart, of every part, of every stone, of every grave

It falls apart, there's not a heart to beat there
It falls apart if there's not a heart to have (The animal instinct fluttering away from the start)
It falls apart, there's not a heart to beat there
It falls apart if there's not a heart to have

A tangled mess of knots, I confess
But the intent was there, I swear
We set our sights on something that we thought was true

It falls apart, there's not a heart to beat there
And it falls apart if there's not a heart to have (The animal instinct fluttering away from the start)
It falls apart, there's not a heart to beat there
It falls apart if there's not a heart to have
If there's not a heart to have (We ended up a tiny piece)
It falls apart, there's not a heart to beat there (Of every part, of every heart, of every stone, of every grave)
It falls apart if there's not a heart to have (The syntax skips, semantics slips, and what we're left, a growing cleft of language lost, tokens unknown)
It falls apart, there's not a heart to beat there (Two feet between and miles apart, no words to speak, been here a week, and still, we haven't got a clue)
It falls apart if there's not a heart to have (We ended up a tiny piece, of every part, of every heart, of every stone, of every grave)
