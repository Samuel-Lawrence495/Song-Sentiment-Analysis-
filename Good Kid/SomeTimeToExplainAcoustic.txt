It's been a while, I've been out on my own
I get a little anxious when you call me on the phone
Somebody said that it, it fades away
But in the interim, it was hard to see that way

It's been a while, I've been out on my own
I'm in denial about living life alone

I said I don't like change but I'm not afraid
Can't keep it together ever anyway
When every page is in disarray
I think we'll be okay
I said I don't like change but I'm not afraid
Can't keep it together ever anyway
When every page is in disarray
I think we'll be okay that way, that way

I thought it'd change when I got older
But the same year came over and over
And the only change that I could feel
Was the aging of my bones
And then in one October
When the sidewalk home was covered over
Well I don't know the method
But you pulled life from the loam

It's been a while, I've been out on my own
I'm in denial about living life alone

I said I don't like change but I'm not afraid
Can't keep it together ever anyway
When every page is in disarray
I think we'll be okay
I said I don't like change but I'm not afraid
Can't keep it together ever anyway
When every page is in disarray
I think we'll be okay that way, that way
