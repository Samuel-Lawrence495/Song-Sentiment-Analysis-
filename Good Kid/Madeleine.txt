And even when you lost your hair to shame and so much gum
I stood beside you then and there until the cut was done
And even when I lost myself in all of those tall trees
You took me down, you held me up
You patched my bloody knees

And then when we were older, there were miles between
I conjured you an apparition
To show you what we'd seen
The sun, the earth, the wind, the rain and holding out for change
And all the snow you couldn't let go you danced atop a train

I'll go wherever you go
I'll go wherever you go
I'll go wherever you go
I'll go wherever you go
I'll go

I'll go wherever you go
I'll go wherever you go
I'll go wherever you go
I'll go wherever you, ever you

Madeleine who lost the Earth
Made it out by noon
The sun had shined the Earth as well
Her eyes were two half-moons
And even when we lost ourselves to something in between
The words we shared are all still there to show us where we'd been

I'll go wherever you go
I'll go wherever you go
I'll go wherever you go
I'll go wherever you go
