I'll tell you a story
Of blood, guts, and glory
And all that was lost on the way
There was nothing to do
And nowhere to run
There was nothing that I could say

Are the dust in my eyes enough
To tell me what to do
And the bullet you left in my thigh
Well I'm giving it back to you
It wasn't always that easy
No, it wasn't always that slow
I just thought you'd like to know this time
I just thought you'd like to know

And did you tell your mother what you did to me that day?
Or when she asked you where you found success
Did you simply turn away?
I'm coming for you now
And I'm coming for her too
And when you're in the ground
Well maybe I'll be done with you

It wasn't always that easy
No it wasn't always that slow
And when the gun was cocked
And when the bullet was set
Well there was nowhere left to go

It wasn't always that easy
No it wasn't always that slow
I just thought you'd like to know this time
I just thought you'd like to know

And was I wrong
Was it fated from the start
Or did I stand a chance at all
Here I'll wait inside a bar for that proverbial hammer to fall
And he's coming for me now
Oh he's coming for her too
And when we're in the ground
Well then we'll still have nothing left that we can do
That we can do
That we can do

Are the dust in my eyes enough
To tell me what to do
And the bullet you left in my thigh
Well I'm giving it back to you
It wasn't always that easy
No, it wasn't always that slow
I just thought you'd like to know this time
I just thought you'd like to know
