Three years ago, one month today
The second left, but lost my way
And now I turn through heather walls
When Jenny says she's seen it all
She means from here to down the hall
And she is right in her own way

But I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin' out of string
And I ruin, I ruin, I ruin everything
But I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin' out of string
(Come back and you'll still find me)
And I ruin, I ruin, I ruin everything
(Come back and you'll still find me)

At the Premier Inn
I don't know when time begins
I don't know when time begins
At the Premier Inn
I don't know when time begins
I don't know when time begins

The flowers hang a violet hue
The clocks run back, and so should you
Lest Jenny starts her old refrain
The seasons change, the walls remain
I can't recall my mother's name
Nor will I use it if I do

But I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin' out of string
And I ruin, I ruin, I ruin everything
But I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin' out of string
(Come back and you'll still find me)
And I ruin, I ruin, I ruin everything
(Come back and you'll still find me)

At the Premier Inn
I don't know when time begins
I don't know when time begins
At the Premier Inn
I don't know when time begins
I don't know when time begins

At the Premier Inn
I don't know when time begins
I don't know when time begins
At the Premier Inn
I don't know when time begins
I don't know when time begins
I don't know when time begins
