Why do I have to stay here on the ground? It's overrated
The cityscape escapes you with a sound, it's delineated
I waited at the station for an hour, but I won't make it
You take off on an updraft by the tower and you overtake it

Every moon that I see you on the rise
You're drawn across the sky
Now that ink has dried, and I can't tell you why

Oh, Mimi, can you tell me there's an issue?
I've seen it clouded all around you
I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before
Oh, Mimi, can you tell me there's an issue?
I've seen it clouded all around you
I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before
I can't tell you why, oh, I can't tell you why

Why do you have to stay here on the ground? It's overrated
The cityscape berates you with a sound, it's delineated
And no one here has even learned your name, but they all claim it
They saw you land and ran to do the same, but they won't make it

Every moon that I see you on the rise
You're drawn across the sky
Now that ink has dried, and I can't tell you why

Oh, Mimi, can you tell me there's an issue?
I've seen it clouded all around you
I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before
Oh, Mimi, can you tell me there's an issue?
I've seen it clouded all around you
I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before
And I can't tell you why

(And I can't tell you why)
(And I can't tell you why)
(And I can't tell you why)

(I can't tell you why) Tell me there's an issue
(I can't tell you why) I've seen it clouded all around you
(I can't tell you why) I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before
(I can't tell you why) Oh, Mimi, can you tell me there's an issue?
(I can't tell you why) I've seen it clouded all around you
(I can't tell you why) I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before
And I can't tell you why, I can't tell you why
