Baby if you don't stand for something
How can you ever stand at all?
Baby if you're built on sand
You'll be swept back by the fall

Baby if you don't stand for something
How could you ever hope to hold the weight of everything you hold?
Maybe if you built your house on sand
You could burrow the deeper
Maybe it would cave on you alone

Swear I did, I tried, I swear I did
Thousand times to let it lie
Thousand times to let it lie
Swear I did, I tried, I swear I did
Thousand times to let it lie
Thousand times to let it lie

Baby if you don't stand for something
How could you ever hope to hold the weight of everything you hold?
Maybe if you show them all your hand
You could nod in the creases
Or maybe you could take it back and fold

You said it was out in the aether
Each thought that you said you could feed her
She said she was nothing but eager
Then you said
She said that you couldn't believe her
Each thought that you said you could feed her
She said it was all just to lead her then
You said, you said, you said, you said, you said, you-

Swear I did, I tried, I swear I did
Thousand times to let it lie
Thousand times to let it lie
Swear I did, I tried, I swear I did
Thousand times to let it lie
Thousand times to let it lie

Swear I did, I tried, I swear I did
Thousand times to let it lie
Thousand times to let it lie
Swear I did, I tried, I swear I did
Thousand times to let it lie
Thousand times to let it lie

I heard that you weren't sure (I swear, I did, I tried)
And I called it off again (I swear, I did, I tried)
And I heard that you weren't sure (I swear, I did, I tried)
And I called it off again
