We couldn't fallow the fields, we couldn't live off the yields
And so we slowly slipped away
It was a city of jade from the year it was made
Then it started to decay

But I'm still here
Lost everythin', everythin'

But I know that it will fall, the crumbling walls
And it's all that is left to me
It seems like we're in withdrawal, but so are they all
And it's all that is left to me
I write your name into stone and read it alone
And it's all that is left to me
Your love songs cover this home, but nobody knows
And it's all that is left to me

And in the temple divine, can't tell the writing from vines
But then I know just what they'll say
"Here stood a mightier kind, Tikal and Copán combined"
But then they started to decay

But I'm still here
Lost everythin', everythin'

But I know that it will fall, the crumbling walls
And it's all that is left to me
It seems like we're in withdrawal, but so are they all
And it's all that is left to me
I write your name into stone and read it alone
And it's all that is left to me
Your love songs cover this home, but nobody knows
And it's all that is left to me

I know that it will fall, the crumbling walls
And it's all that is left to me
It seems like we're in withdrawal, but so are they all
And it's all that is left to me
I write your name into stone and read it alone
And it's all that is left to me
Your love songs cover this home, but nobody knows
And it's all that is left to me
