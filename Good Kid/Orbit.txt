I've been, I've been thinking that
I can't quite get enough time
On the inside of the cycle that you spin with
Gravity and dust, I've fallen in between the planets and the sun

Into the orbit that surrounds you
That orbit that's around you
That orbit that surrounds you
That orbit that's around you

Now the space is filling up
Satellites that I can't seem to keep track of
I get the feeling I'm not quite made of the right stuff
To float between the rings of cosmic metal love

Into the orbit that surrounds you
That orbit that's around you
That orbit that surrounds you
That orbit that's around you

T-minus five, four, three, two, one
Ignition sequence

That orbit that surrounds you (That orbit that surrounds)
That orbit that's around you (That orbit that's around)
That orbit that surround you
That orbit that's around you
